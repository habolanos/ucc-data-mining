- Many thanks to @mbloch for help with debugging Mapshaper <> PostGIS compatibility

GENERAL

1)	Ensure "empty" text fields have minimum length of 1 char for PostGIS compatibility.
    As the housekeeping DBFs are joined with the Mapshaper cracked features, the
    5.y.z series would produce zero length text fields, which are valid but are
    incompatible with PostGIS. A new version of Mapshaper, used here, now produces
    a minimum of 1 char text length fields even if all column values are empty.

GENERAL

1)	Add top-level-country (TLC) point-of-view (POV) with shapefile, cleanup the existing
    ISO POV, add shapefile export for ISO point-of-view, and bug fix polish for alternate
    points-of-view added in v5.0.0 and v5.0.1.

HOUSEKEEPING

- UPDATED:  NE_ADMIN_0_DETAILS
            - Add TLC point-of-view for 347 top-level-countries needing "tender loving
              care" – for any place that might possibly be labeled as a "country" or
              "dependency" in any POV, or otherwise not contiguous with it's home
              territory so needs an explanatory label. See adm0_tlc and fclass_tlc
              columns, and should be paired with note_adm0 or note_brk columns to give
              context to the feature's sovereignty. FCLASS_TLC values include:
              Admin-0 country (eg United States), Admin-0 dependency (eg Puerto Rico),
              Admin-1 region (eg England, Scotland, Wales, and Norther Ireland constituant
              countries of the United Kingdom), Admin-1 states provinces (eg Martinique
              with France or Alaska with United States which are both non-contiguous with
              their home or "metropolitan" territory), Admin-0 lease (eg Baykonur
              Cosmodrome leased to Russia), Admin-0 breakaway and disputed (eg Golan
              Heights between Israel and Syria), Admin-0 claim area (eg Crimea between
              Ukraine and Russia), Admin-0 indeterminant (eg Spratly Islands which is
              contested and administered by many countries), Island group (eg Midway
              Islands which is part of the United States Minor Outlying Islands
              dependency), and Island (eg Antigua which is a component of the country
              Antigua and Barbuda, or Jan Mayen which is part of the Svalbard and Jan
              Mayen dependency).
            - Refine ISO point-of-view properties for 249 countries, dependencies, and
              "it's complicated" admin-1 (eg Taiwan and overseas French regions).
              Rename adm0_a3_iso to adm0_iso as it was getting clipped to adm0_a3_is
              which is a reserved 2-char country code. FCLASS_ISO values include:
              Admin-0 country (eg United States), Admin-0 dependency (eg Puerto Rico),
              Admin-1 states provinces (eg Taiwan), and Unrecognized (eg England).
            - Add TLC (superset of ISO) and TLC_DIFF boolean columns to support the above
            - Add label_x and label_y columns to support stand alone point-based labeling
            - Mark Kosovo as recognized by fewer countries and by TLC (but not ISO)
            - Mark Somaliland as recognized by Taiwan and TLC
              (but not ISO or any other country)
            - Mark Northern Cyprus as recognized by Turkey and TLC
              (but not ISO or any other country)
            - Mark Taiwan as recognized by itself and TLC
              (but as an admin-1 by ISO)
            - Adjust all existing POV with Admin-0 map unit to more fine grained values
            - Add Sir Creek dispute between Pakistan and India
            - Add North Boreno dispute between Malaysia and Philippines
            - Provide optional grouping of separate Andaman Islands and Nicobar Islands
              which form a single Admin-1 for India, needed for TLC POV
            - Cleanup BRK_GROUP, NOTE_ADM0, and NOTE_BRK columns

2018-05-21: 4.1.0

- Many thanks to @imresamu for name translations and Wikidata concordances, @mattbloch
  for MapShaper feature development, and hat tips to @planemad for Wikidata concordances,
  Mapbox generally for leading the way with Wikidata name translations, and
  @thisisaaronland for ne_id work with Brooklyn Integers. Also to @randymeech and
  @bcamper at Mapzen (RIP) for sponsoring this work as a parting gift to the geo family.

GENERAL

1) Expands the name localization added in v4.0 to 21 languages (up from 7) and several
   dozen themes expanding from populated places to include all admin-0, admin-1,
   rivers, lakes, playas, geographic lines, physical labels, parks, airports, and
   more. As part of this work a new unique and stable "ne_id" has been added for any
   feature with a name translation &/or a Wikidata ID concordance. The full list of
   languages is: name_ar*, name_bn*, name_de, name_en, name_es, name_fr, name_el*,
   name_hi*, name_hu*, name_id*, name_it*, name_ja*, name_ko*, name_nl*, name_pl*,
   name_pt, name_ru, name_sv*, name_tr*, name_vi*, and name_zh. (Names with * indicate
   new language in v4.1 series.) A 2-character language code decoder ring is here:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes. Props to Wikidata for their
   CC0 license: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Introduction.
2) Fixes admin-0 polygons for for Bosnia & Herzegovina to restore the
   Republic Srpska and the Brcko District condominium.
3) Renames admin-0 Swaziland features to eSwatini to keep up with current events.
4) Fixes physical label polygons to restore full geometries.
5) Switches to MapShaper for topology building and joining of attributes for all
   administrative themes and 10m land and ocean themes. Some shapes were adjusted to
   fit new snapping tolerances.

2017-10-15: 4.0.0

- Many thanks to the over 50 people who contributed to the v4 release of Natural Earth,
  we couldn't do it without you! Jeremy, @raffam, @pnorman, @mojodna, @imresamu, Hannes,
  Axel, @pinakographo, @CaucasusandMercury, @jschleuss, Martha, Kuba, Jesús, Arkadiy,
  Philip, Benedikt, Ivor, @almccon, Jacob, Alice, Geoffrey, @ajmas, @instantdelay, Matt,
  Daniel, Felix, @karimbahgat, @migurski, Olaf, @mvexel, @yaph, Jessica, @kernc, Quentin,

  @dshorthouse, @pinakographos, Alain, Aileen, Daniel, Charles, Martin, Aaron, MattA,
  StephenE, NathanielD, Aron, Lou, and others.

GENERAL

1) The v4 series introduces significant changes to admin-0 country shapes to account for
   the disputed area of Crimea, and several important admin-0 country name changes like
   Czechia renamed from Czech Republic. Admin-0 population and GDP values have also been
   updated to 2016/2017 vintage (primarily from CIA World Factbook).
2) The v4 series introduces web map optimized min_zoom, min_label, max_label properties
   that compliment the existing scalerank property that was originally curated for print
   cartography in proper projection glory. The min_zoom property is optimized for the web
   Mercator projection we are collectively hallucinating, and the min_label and max_label
   properties are optional on some themes when the label should be displayed later than
   the feature's geometry (or should stop showing). Fixes: #200, #202.
3) While the v3 series went full UTF-8 unicode (character encoding) language support a few
   errors were made along the way. v4 fixes bad Windows-1252 to UTF-8 conversion bugs. We
   also better document with the character encoding by adding a .cpg file to shapefile,
   and on the Natural Earth website documentation. Fixes #89, #186, 4RUN1M5S75; thanks
   Jeremy and @pnorman.
4) We added French names for marine areas way back in v1.4.0, and v4 adds many thousand
   more for populated places in the following languages: name_en, name_de, name_es,
   name_fr, name_pt, name_ru, name_zh. The existing name, name_alt, and nameascii fields
   have been updated, and name features over 600 labels with accent marks (versus the 80
   or so that were garbled in the v3 series).

2013-06-02: 3.0.0

- Many thanks to the individuals who contributed over the last year of development: Tom,
Nathaniel, staff of Geographx in New Zealand, David at foursquare and more.

GENERAL

1) Updates to the admin-1 layer in 10m series to radically increase coverage, quality, and
move towards fully UTF-8 based Shapefiles, no more GeoDB! Because everything is now SHP
format, the 50m and 110m admin-1 files have also been renamed.
2) Updates in New Zealand for coastline, rivers, lakes, geographic areas, roads, railroad,
and populated places.
3) Coastline updates in New Zealand, deletion of Sandy Island, and other admin-1 adjustments
force the admin-0, and ocean, land & some bathymetry polygons to rebuild.
4) Pinnacles National Monument elevated to National Park.
5) Salish Sea added for physical marine label areas.
6) Minor changes for Russian hydrology in 10m and 50m series.
7) Sister site quattroshapes.com launches with administrative data at nominal 1:100,000 scale.

- Many thanks to the individuals who contributed over the last year of development: Tom,
Nathaniel, Alex Tait, Hans van der Maarel, Scott Zillmer, Mike Migurski, Daniel Huffman,
Xan Gregg, Peter Bispham, Drew Noakes, Miguel Angel Vilela, Matthew Toro, Kevin Pickell,
Shawn Allen, Robert Coup, Iain, Leo, and more! Thanks also to Stamen thru the Knight
Foundation Citytracking grant for sponsoring a portion of this work including remastering
geometries for better PostGIS import, the move to Github, and adopting semantic versioning.

GENERAL

- UPDATED:  NATURAL_EARTH_UPDATE_2.0.0 - This release focuses on 7 major areas:
1) Economic geography: adds global roads, railroads, ports, airports, and time zones to
show how people are interconnected and goods route.
2) Remastered geometries: fixes topological errors at 1:10 to 1:1,000 scales in the basic
coastline, ocean, land, admin-0, and admin-1 related themes for files in the the 1:10m
scaleset. By removing self-intersections, sliver polygons, and adjusting offset polygons,
Natural Earth imports into more GIS software (like PostGIS) and will be easier to
maintain. The coastline is adjusted to better conform to ~1:3,000,000 satellite imagery.
Because of all these changes, some raster themes are also updated. Land, ocean, and minor
islands all build topologically by scripting ingredients, as do the admin-0 and admin-1
cultural themes.
3) Introduce Gray Earth rasters. Worldwide terrain depicted monochromatically in shades of
gray. It combines shaded relief and regionally adjusted hypsography that emphasizes both
high mountains and the micro terrain found in lowlands. View new raster »
4) New file name and field name schemas. Full adoption of ne_10m_theme_name.shp file names
with `ne_` prefix to allow better import into GeoDB and PostGIS storage, lowercase field
(column) names instead of MiXeD and UPPER cased names, and use of consistent `name` field
(versus name1).
5) Address user submitted bug reports, ~25 since the 1.4 release, and earlier.
6) Moved to Github for the backend versioned file management and coordination. Includes
scripts to package updates and auto-create derived themes.
7) Adopt semantic versioning. Know, by theme, the level of effort needed to update your
maps when Natural Earth data updates are released.
* Other notable changes:
All themes now include README and VERSION files. The admin-0 attributes have more veracity
and now includes nested disputed areas (was a sidecar). Adds continent, region, subregion
codes. Adds versions of country and admin-1 without boundary lakes.  All places and parts
of places have population and GDP estimates. The populated places pop_max and pop_min
attributes are now fully built out for all records (pop max is for the metropolitan area,
pop_min is for the incorporated city of the same name). populated places now include
rank_max and rank_min for simple town size grading. All instances of name1 have been
changed to name, name to name, name2 to name_alt. Vertexes were added to many themes to
allow them to project into conics smoothly (they're back!). All field (column) names are
now generally in the order of: scalerank, featurecla, name, name_alt, natscale,
labelrank, *.

        where it remains.
- CHANGED:  Where the Snake River joins the Columbia River, part of the path of the
        Columbia was marked as the Snake.

        Name, Name2 is now Name_alt Removed River, abbreviated Creek, North, South,
        East, West, Branch, etc. in the Name column to make consistent with the basic
        Rivers theme. Preserved the original in Name_full.
- CHANGED:  River names in U.S. desert south west. via Daniel Huffman, below:
- CHANGED:  The Marias River, a tributary of the Missouri in Montana, is listed as the
        “Marais” in the Natural Earth dataset.
- CHANGED:  Upper portion of the stream marked as the “Maury River” (tributary to the
        James in Virginia) is the Calfpasure River, which joins the Little Calfpasture
        River a bit southeast of Goshen to form the Maury.
- CHANGED:  Rivnum 23000 is the San Pedro River. The Natural Earth line appears to give a
        source just inside the US, but the National Atlas line has a source in Mexico.
- CHANGED:  Rivnum 22432 is San Cristobal Wash.
- CHANGED:  Rivnum 22467 is Centennial Wash

- NEW:      Europe rivers supplement Database structure changes: Name1 is now Name, Name2
        is now Name_alt
- CHANGED:  Marine label areas - Now includes French names for most features. Corrections
        for Helodranon’ Antongila to Antongila Bay. Karskiye Vorota Strait looses
        Vorota as that already means Straight.
- CHANGED:  Graticules at 10m, 50m, 110m now have reasonable ScaleRank values.
- CHANGED:  Geographic lines at 10m, 50m, and 110m demotes the pre 1995 date line segment
        down to 100, giving Null Island company. Display column has been removed, Name
        column added with shorter version of the old Display name. Name_Long contains
        that former column, but renamed in keeping with current Natural Earth
        practices. Also, Abbrev column added for short names. Note now contains the
        “1995 Kiribati adjustment” and the like, including: “Any given day starts here
        and progresses west, with yesterday nipping at its heals.” And a FeatureClass
        column to bring into alignment with Natural Earth current practices.

        Maine and New Brunswick.
- CHANGED:  Admin-1 polygons and lines, 10m - Small portion of the Rhode
        Island/Massachusetts boundary was missing in the NEV databases. The portion
        in question was the part of Rhode Island that lies on the mainland, just east
        of the Sakonnet River and the city of Newport, and just south of Fall
        River, MA.
- CHANGED:  All US state boundary fixes: R.I.-Mass., Va.-N.C. now bends south in the
        middle., Del.-Penn. boundary bends differently., Tenn.-Ala.-Ga.-Miss.,
        Kan.-Col., Neb.-Co., Neb.-Wy., S.D.-Wy., S.D.-Mont., N.D.-Mont., Iowa-Mo.,
        Modify the DC shape a bit to better match more detailed zooms and remove part
        of the adm-1 line on the shore.
- CHANGED:  The ADM1NAME Ãstfold corrected to Østfold.
- CHANGED:  Zhejiang – Should be labeled as the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Is part of
        Australia. RENAMED Niue – Is not part of Australia, but independent.
        Associated with New Zealand. DELETED as admin-1 units are not shown for small
        countries. Kerguelen Islands are part of France DELETED as admin-1 units are
        not shown for small countries.
- CHANGED:  Niassa Province in Mozambique is incorrectly spelled as ‘Nassa’. ‘Niassa’ is
        there as a varname, but the province has never been called ‘Nassa’.
- CHANGED:  Populated places (10m, 50m and 110m) - Norwegian cities, in whole related to
        the special characters æ, ø and å. The following corrections should be made:
        Baerum -> Bærum, Svolvaer -> Svolvær, Tonsberg -> Tønsberg and
        Vadso -> Vadsø.
- CHANGED:  Baguio City in the Philippines is still the defacto summer location of the
        supreme court (judiciary branch of government), a similar situation as Chile
        and a couple other countries, but is now coded as “Admin-0 cap alt”. However,
        Quezon City and Pasay City are downgraded from Admin-0 capital alt to
        “Populated place” as the recent constitution states that the entire admin-1
        unit of Manila is the national capital and they fall inside that feature.
- CHANGED:  The place name Wiener Neustadt in Austria (that is the proper name of the
        city) had the wrong NAME attribute “Wiener”.
- CHANGED:  Across the Mekong from Nakhon Phanom (Thailand), Natural Earth has a
        settlement marked “Khammouan” in Laos. Khammouan(e) is the name of a province.
        The actual city across the river appears to be the capital of said province,
        Thakhek.
- CHANGED:  San Carlos moved east out of Lake Nicaragua.

- CHANGED:  Populated places: Fix handful of city issues in all scales.
- NEW:      New countries: The Netherlands Antilles was dissolved in October 2010 and two
        new countries (Sint Maarten and Curaçao) were created out of part of the
        former territory, with the remaining islands devolved back to Netherlands as

- CHANGED:  Admin-1 there is some indication provided when to alternate these based on
        labelRank and scaleRank.
- CHANGED:  Admin01 region coding has also been provided for UK and US, could expand in
        the future (address inconsistency in France and Italy in particular where
        Natural Earth continues to show admin 1 regions rather than departments).
- CHANGED:  States and provinces (both polygons and lines) now have correct ADM0_A3 codes
        and use the same MAP_COLOR column as the adm-0 in all scale sets.
- NEW:      Due to popular demand, a new supplementary version of the adm_1 polygons are
        provided with large lakes erased
- CHANGED:  Added SameAsCity column to indicate if the label should be placed only at a
        certain natural scale since the adm-1 name is the same (or very similar) to

- CHANGED:  Added scale ranking to adm-1 lines so they can appear in tandem with the polys.
- CHANGED:  Countries with notable admin-1 changes: Algeria, Australia, Bangladesh,

        Costa Rica, Croatia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Estonia, Greece, Haiti,
        Ireland, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Russia, Slovenia, Slovenia, Spain
- REMOVED:  Deletions on a country basis: Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Northern Cyprus,
        Martinique and French Guiana arrondissements merged.
- ADDED:    Added missing adm-1 lines: Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, India, Israel, Mexico,
        Rwanda, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Syria, Yemen

- CHANGED:  Adm-1 gaps: Closed a few inside polygon “donut holes” adm_1 lines that didn’t
        have coincidental start-end points: Germany to Mongolia, Panama to Australia
        and Yemen. Ethiopia. Taiwan. Others.
